        <p class="lead mb-4">I am both a curious and independent person. I really enjoy learning how things work and I would rather do things myself than have others do them for me. I suppose it is for that reason that I am, and have always been, fascinated by science. I ask questions all the time: for example, will sea hares be affected by the changing pH of ocean water? Science allows someone like me to ask many questions and be able to answer them on my own, which appeals to my independent nature.<br><br>
        
Since my freshman biology class, my love for the sciences has increased significantly. This led me to join the Young Scientist Program at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. Here, I have worked with mentors to conduct experiments on topics I am most interested in. In order, the studies that I have done include the effect of ocean acidification on the development of Aplysia californica, the effect of pH on Aplysia californica egg masses, and the effect of change in temperature on egg laying in Melibe leonina. I presented these studies at the Young Scientist Symposium. I have also participated in the Palos Verdes Peninsula Science and Engineering Fair as well as the Los Angeles County Science and Engineering Fair in the last two years, obtaining second place and honorable mention respectively at these fairs last year, as well as the United States Air Force Certificate of Achievement. This year, I received the Naval Science Award at the Palos Verdes Science and Engineering Fair.    
<br><br>
During the summer of my tenth grade year, I was accepted into the highly competitive Neurolab program by Coastal Marine Biolabs. This is a ten-day program funded by the National Institutes of Health. In this program, we got to experience the day-to-day work of actual researchers. We helped test for expression of genes by using different processes and complex techniques such as making recombinant DNA, in-ovo electroporation, and open-book spinal cord dissections. I learned many laboratory procedures and techniques through this program. 
<br><br>
I learned a lot from these experiences, but most importantly, I learned that science is about sharing information so others can also learn from what we have discovered. Personally, I would benefit from the National Youth Science Camp because I can meet other people who share a common interest in the sciences. I can learn so much more because everyone comes from different places and have different ideas, allowing an exchange in ideas and study methods, which I can bring back with me and to whatever future science career I choose. 
	<br><br>
	Science is everywhere in our daily lives; it is in all the innovations and technology we use today. We continue to use science to raise the standard of living and improve the human society as a whole. People now live longer than they ever have in the past because of the advances in technology made possible through science. I hope I can become a part of the driving force behind the improvement of mankind.
